            The significance of Information Technology on this world is
            expanding at an extremely quick speed. Today, there is not really
            any individual whose life isn't moved by Information Technology. In
            our daily lives, we have integrated the products and end means of
            information technology whether it's the operating systems on the
            computer networks that automate a company's tasks and processes, our
            mobile phones, or the vast amount of information sought and found on
            the internet. This translates ostensibly that careers in the
            information technology sector are expected to grow significantly in
            the upcoming years.
